Spaz prototype and PoC.

You, the player, are the black circle. 
You can move by using the arrow keys or W, S, A, and D keys.
You can only move onto tiles that are the same color as the one you are currently standing on.
Click a tile to change its color.
The diamonds are gems. Collect them to complete a level.
The other objects represent helpful items and obstacles. This version doesn't include interaction with those.
